# Revisions and the Cloud

As you make progress and changes in your code overtime software called Version control systems are used to track these changes. This allows you to revisit previous versions of a file or revert back to a previous version of a project or file. This is a great way to rectify any mistakes and track modifications. Version control systems can be acessed locally or via a server which different users can access.

While using Git and Github a user can copy a repository created on git hub and access the files locally, this is know as *cloning*. Cloning copies all versions of a project and allows the user to edit all of these files. In order for the user to track and stage a file they must add it to the staging area followed by making a *commit*. This is done first by using the *git add filename* command followed by *git commit -m "a message"*. It is good practice to add a message (-m "") to each commit to remind yourself or let anyone else on tte project what changes you have made. Every time a file is committed Git creates a snapshot of the file. If no changes have occured then Git stores the original referrence stored with the file. To view the snapshot in your working directory use the command *git status*. Once you have committed all the changes to your file you will need to upload this to Github, or "push" the file. This is performed with the *git push repository name* command.
