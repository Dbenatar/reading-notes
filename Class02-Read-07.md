HTML tables should not be used for page layouts for a number of reasons. Using a table for a page layout reduces accesibility for visually impared users. A tables use of more complex markup structures leads to poor layout techniques, which can result in code that is harder to read, maintain or debug. Tables are sized according to their content by default, unlike using proper layout containers which have their widths at 100% by default.

A basic HTML table consists of cells inside rows and columns. A teble cell is defined by a "td", or table data tag. Table rows are started with the table row tag (tr), provided the number of cells are the same in each row, you can have as many rows as you like. The top row of your table will use the table header (th) tag, which by default sets the text to bold and centered.

Javascript constructor functions are a special method of a class for creating and intitialising an object instance of that class. A constructor function enables you to provide an initialisation that must be done before any other methods can be called on an object. The term _this_ is different when used in a constructor over a regular object. In a constructor function it is not a variable, Rather _this_ is a keyword referring to an object.
