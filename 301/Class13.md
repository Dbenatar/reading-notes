Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?

There are a lot of similarities between REST and CRUD, REST applications often use CRUD-like functions. They are built around resources that can be created, read, updated and deleted. CRUD functions are used for interaction with database applications.

If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?

1.Create a server and set up the router and endpoints
2.Starting with writing a handler fuinction to GET resources.
3.Create handler function to POST requests.
4.Use HTTP PUT method to update a resource.
5.Add function DELETE, this can be done with the **findByIdAndDelete** method
