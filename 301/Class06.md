# Rest

1. **To what extent did psychological safety impact your previous work experience?**

I left my previous job before this bootcamp as I realised I was tired of the chef industry, this kitchen in particular where I worked under a chef with some talent but no experience. I eventually got sick of the attitude and ego.

2. **How does this article inform your approach to working with others moving forward?**

Moving forward I will do my best in whatever kind of team I end up in to make sure people know the specific roles and expetations, myself included. I think in the past I have often avoided speaking up for myself to avoid confrontation .

## Explaining REST

1. Roy Fielding helped write the first web servers which sent documents across the internet. Upon doing this he conducted his research explaining why the web works in the way it does.

2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

Initially the design of the web needed to talk to a small group of machines, where as now it is needed to talk to machines all across the world.

What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

The purpose of the HTTP protocol is all about applying verbs to nouns, for example when you go to a web page, the browser uses an HTTP GET on the URL and comes bac kwith a web page to display.

What does a GET do?
Retrieves a specific resource (by id) or a collection of resources.

What does a POST do?
Creates a new resource.

What does PUT do?
Updates a specific resource (by id).

What does PATCH do?
Removes a specific resource by id.
