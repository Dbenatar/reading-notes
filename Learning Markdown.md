# What is Markdown?

Markdown is stripped back very basic markup language which can be used to add formatting elements to plain text documents. Unlike a word processor application, such as Microsoft Word, changes to the format, words or text are not visible immediately. But rather using Markdown syntax and then format the text to look different. For example using symbols like "#" to add a header to some text.

## Why do we use Markdown?
There are many advantages to using Markdown instead of something like Microsoft Word. Such as, Markdown is an independent of platform which means you can use it on any operating system. As well as it being so widely acessible due to its independent platform,it can be accessed anywhere from reddit to Github and a number of desktop applications. Being able to Markdown via any text editor makes it futureproof. Even if the application you currently use stops working, you can use it on another text editor.

To create a heading using Markdown you simply use a # symbol and a space before the text you wish to turn into a header. You can add up to six # to determine which size of header you would like to use.
