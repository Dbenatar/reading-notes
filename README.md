## Growth Mindset
Growth mindset is a way of thinking of learning as something not as rigid as having initial talent or inteligence in a subject. By embracing a new way of learning and with time, dedication and an eagerness to learn I can learn something new. This constrasts a fixed mindet, which is certainly a way I have felt about learning new, challenging things in the past. The feeling of finding something hard and thinking I will never be able to learn it. 

##Things to keep telling myself

- Time
- Persistance
- Embracing the challenge

>“We only know a tiny proportion about the complexity of the natural world. Wherever you look, there are still things we don’t know about and don’t understand. [...] There are always new things to find out if you go looking for them.”
― David Attenborough


Hi, I am Dom. I am a professional chef wanting a career change into tech. This exercise and growth mindset as a whole makes me think about the first time I watched Jurassic Park as a child. When found out that a lot of it was made using computers. Having no understanding of what that really meant, I just always put it down as the kind of thing I would never be able to learn. This year I have begun my journey into learning about coding and while I have really struggled with some things, I have surprised and impressed myself when learning something new.
