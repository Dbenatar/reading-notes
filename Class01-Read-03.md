# CSS Layout

The Flexbox layourt makes it easier to design responsive layout structure without using float or positioning. Flexbox is one deminsional which means that it deals with layout in one dimension at a time, either a row or a column.

The main axis is defined by flex-direction which has four possible values. row or coloumn, and reverse of row and column. The cross axis runs perpendicular to the main axis.

Adjusting any properties that reorder the visual display away from how things are ordered in the HTML document can negatively impact accessibility. Good examples of this are the reverse row and column values.The reordering only happens for the visual order, not the logical order, and as the logical order is the order that a screen reader will read out the content.

Positioning child elements becomes easier with flexbox instead of using float.Flexbox is also responsive and also mobile friendly. Flexbox also allows us to easily change the order of elements without making changes to the HTML code.

While I still have much to learn with CSS but I do find it very satisfying when it works. It is less daunting to me than JS but I am enjnoying learning aobut and getting better at both languages.
