# HTML lists, Control flow with JS and the CSS Box model

## Learn HTML

An Unordered list tag is used in HTML for a list of items with no numerical ordering, most often using bullet points. There are a couple of different styles of bullet point which can be used. This can be done by ustilising the **list-style-property** property inside of the opnening tag and choosing from the value, disc, circle, square or none. The fourth bullet type of triangle is not supported by all browsers. If the user has a list of numerical value to display the Ordered list tag should be used which lists the items with numbers instead of bullet points. An ordered list can list items using letters as well as numbers or can start a list at a particular number, either by using **type="i"** inside of the opening Ol tag or **start="5"**, for example.

## The CSS Box model

The margin property is a transparent space which clears an area outside of the border. The padding, like the margin, is also transparent and clears area around the content.

The other parts of the box model are the content of the box, this is where the text or image appears. Inbetween the padding and the margin is the border of the box, this goes around the outside of the padding and has a few diffent style options. The border can be given custom sizes, colours and styles such as dotted lines, dash lines or a solid line.
