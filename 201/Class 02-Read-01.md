The _transform_ property applies transformation to an element which can be 2d or 3d. This could be implimented to move, rotate or scale an element on the page. For example a button that when you hover over it, it rotates.

A CSS _transition_ allows the developer to change the property value smoothly over a chosen duration. While similar to CSS _Animations_, transitions are generally much simpler. Animations are more difficult to use with Javascript but are best for creating a complex series of movements.

Benefits of using a transition are easier to create, they only run once and only once they have been triggered, like a mouse hover. They are best for creating a simple change from one state to another on a webpage. Such as toggling between a light and dark theme.
