# Video and Audio content

Over the last 20 years the use of video and audio on the web has evolved significantly due to improvements in quality and rendering of these files.

When using the HTML video tag, you will need to use a src or _source_ to link to the file you wish to view on the page. Adding a _control_ attribute will allow the browser to offer controls for the user to control playback.

If the content inside of the video tags is not supported by the browser _fallback_ content is shown.

CSS grid and flex both offere similar styling on your content.Where _flex_ is more one dimensional and can either effect rows or columns. _Grid_ can be used to declare the sizing of both rows and columns at once.

Grid containers consist of grid items, placed inside columns and rows. Grid items are teh child element of the parent grid container. If the grid container on the page is split up into 9, 3 rows and 3 columns. The tope of the container will be grid line 1 going all the way to line 4 in each direction.

Making a website responsive is not just important for use on different screen sizes but different devices, from a desktop pc, to a tablet or phone. Allowing more people to use the website regardless of the device they are using.

The img HTML tag is used to place an image on the page. The _srcset_ and _sizes_ attributes specify the URL of hte image to be used in different situations. Such as a phone screen in portait or landscape. By using the srcset attribute image sizing is much simpler and allows you to define a list of differently sized version of the same image and provide information about each size to the browser.
