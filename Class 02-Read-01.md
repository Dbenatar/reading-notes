In order for a browser to display a website, a program needs to be converted into an internal format. For example, HTML tokens ustilise start and end tages in its attributes. Parsing HTML uses tree construction, a hierarchical view of information where items can have a number of sub items.

When CSS styles are encounted by the browser, the text is parsed into the CSSOM, or CSS Object Model.This is a data structure which is used for styling layouts. This is then rendered by the web browser and creates a tree to display the content on the screen. Javascript files are also parsed and executed by the browser. This done during the compile time or whenever the parser is invoked.

When using Javascript a string is created by using the **String()** constructor. When a number is used in Javascript it is merely the digits. Javascript variables are containers for storing data. They are declared using either **let** or **const**, in previous versions of Javascript there was another variable **var**. Variables can contian data like numbers for a sum or a string that we want to use as part of a sentence.

## Introduction to HTML

HTML elements are made up of an opening tag, such as <p> followed by some enclosed text content and closed up with the close tage </p>. There are some tags that do not require a closing tag, such as the image <img> tag. HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements and are always specified within the start tag. To add a link or an img to a tag an attribute would need to be added, for example in an image tag, the **src** attribute is added to specify the path to the specific image.

The <section> tag in HTML defines selected sections of a document, such as headers, footers or chapters. The <article> tag specifies independent, self-contained content that should make sense on its own independently from the rest of the site.

Many elements of a website contribute to success in ranking higher on search enguine results. One of these elements is metadata. Metadata is essentially data about data. This can be the date and time that some data was created. Metadata is very important for Search Engine Optimisation because it provides searh engines with information about the content of a website.

<meta> tags are always positioned in the head of an HTML document, these tags define the metadata about the document, highlighting keywords on the page, the author of the document and viewport settings. This data is used by browsers, search engines and other web services.

A typical website will make use of the HTML elements

- <body>
- <html>
- <head>
- <title>

### How to start to design your website.

When designing a website the first step and arguabley the most important question to ask is "What you are trying to accomplish?" Once this has been decided on, creating a wireframe will help you beggining to buil and structure your website.

### Semantics

The <h1> tage is the main heading or subject for the whole page. <h1> is what is known as a block element, they always start a new line and browsers automatically add a margin before and after the element, whereas <span> is an inline element and cannot contain a block element. An inline element does not start a new line and only takes up as much width as necessasry.

The benefits of using semantic elements are they clearly describe the meaning to both the browser and the developer. <form>, <header>, <table> all clearly define what their content is.

### What is Javascript?

Javascript is a programming language that allows you to implement complex features on your web pages. Javascript is added to an HTML document bit linking a <script></script> tag to your Javascript file. Web browsers require javascript to have any functionality or interactivity for improved user experience.
