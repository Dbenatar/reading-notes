## Javascript Object Basics

I quite like the example of a Jjavascript object that can be seen on w3schools (https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_objects.asp). A real life object like a car, it has properties like weight and colour and methods like start and stop.

Object literals in Javascrips are literally objects. Such as a list of name values seperated by commas and pair inside of curly braces. These vales can be properties or functions.

Both arrays and objects are important in Javascript. Objects are a special data type which can be used to store a collection of data. Arrays are a special type of variable which can be used to store lists of values. It is better to keep arrays to a single data type where as objects can hold multiple.

Dot notation and bracket notion are two ways of accessing object properties in Javascript. The way they access the properties is different, however. For example to get the value of a name property using dot notation you implement **.name** (const target = obj.name). Bracket notation uses square brackets, which has an expression that evaluates to a value. This value is a key for accessing the property. (object[expression]). Bracket notation accepts dynamic keys where as dot notation only allows static keys.

In the sample code **this** refers to the object it is within. Advantages to using this are is values are specific to each instance.

The DOM or _Document Object Model_ is a standard for accessing documents which are created by the browser when a web page is loaded. This includes defining HTML elements as objects, properties of all HTML elements, methods to access all HTML elements. Through the DOM javascript is capable of creating dynamic HTML.
