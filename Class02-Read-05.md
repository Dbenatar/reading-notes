# HTML Media

A use of the <alt> attributeis to have alternative text in case an image cannot be displayed properly on the web page because of a slow connection or if the user is using a screen reader.

When writing HTML code try and make it as semantic as possible to provide a good way to navigate and interact with your website. A way of implementing this is using alternative text for images.

The <figure> element could be used to mark up a photo in a document which is further defined by the use of a <figcaption>.

GIFs are not really videos but more of an collection of annimated images which can appear like a very short video. A GIF file essentially holds multiple images at once and can load them sequentially, like a flipbook. An SVG image is similar but can be created and edited with any text editor. SVG images are scalable (Scalable Vector Graphics), are zoomable and can be printed at high quality resolution.

**PNG** image format is considered an international standard format. It offers many advantages such as portability, transmission is independent of software and hardware platform. The algorithms used are free and accesible. Png images can be compressed efficiently and consistently. There is no loss in quality, filtering and compressing presever all information.
