Chart.js is a free open-source Javascript library of data visualisations. It can be intergrated into your project to render chart elements using the script tag on you HTML file. Chart.js can be used to creat many different types of chart including basic bar charts, pie charts ad well as radar charts.

Both tables and charts are used to display data on the page, however if you have a lot of complicated data to present it is considered better to use a chart. A chart can also be used to show patterns or any trends in the data. Displaying your data in a chart or graph is much easier to take in visually rather that just having a lot of raw data in text on a page.
