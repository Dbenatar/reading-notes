## About me:
Hi, I am Dom. I am a professional chef wanting a career change into tech. This exercise and growth mindset as a whole makes me think about the first time I watched Jurassic Park as a child. When found out that a lot of it was made using computers. Having no understanding of what that really meant, I just always put it down as the kind of thing I would never be able to learn. This year I have begun my journey into learning about coding and while I have really struggled with some things, I have surprised and impressed myself when learning something new.
